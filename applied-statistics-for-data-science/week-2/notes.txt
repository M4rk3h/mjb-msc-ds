Using a lot of classical methods for statistical modeling 

Starting with Probabilities
	independence
	dependence
	calculations around probabilities
	significants?
	finding errors with data

2 tailed test doesn't matter where the tail goes
1 tailed test looks which direction does tail go.

H0 - Null is the provided hypothesis
	coin is fair
H1 - Alternative hypothesis
	coin is not fair

By cutting off at 5% (0.05 p value), this means we will stick with
	H0 95% of the time.
	
Power of the test
	(1 - B) B = Beta ($\beta)

Testing For Normality
	Data is Normal
To have normalised data, the 'bell' needs to be evenly distributed.
	Test for Normality

If true look at Normal Distrubted tests in statistical reference
( Which are? )

Non Parametric
	Data is skewed/ranked/scored.

H0: Mu(mean) = c
H0: Mu(mean) != c
	
H0: m(median) = c
H0: m(median) != c

	Mean can be skewed by outliers, 
so alternative is to test the median

H0: f(x1) = f(x2)
H0: f(x1) != f(x2)
Tests the distribution of data.

H0 : D0 = 0
H0 : D0 != 0
Looking at the same data set over different times
	Weight in's at start and end of diet/exercise

2 Correlation
	2.3 - Non Normal distributed dataset, so we'll have to look at the bottom plot.
	Boxplot is showing the true mean difference, there is not enough evidence to reject null hypothesis.
	
	Signed Rank is a non parametric
	Signed Rank 	S 	-55.5 	Pr >= |S| 	0.2529
	P value is > 0.05 
	Not enough evidence to show the strenght between the 2
	
	Pooled 	Equal 	28 	3.65 	0.0011
	Needs to be rejected as it is < 0.05 (significant difference)
	There is enough evidence to reject them.
