# Exploring the data from Week 1 (Exercise 2 on SAS)

#### Tests
##### annual_mileage per gender
###### 1
H0: There is no significant difference between the annual mileage per gender.
H1: There is a significant difference between the annual mileage per gender.
###### 2
H0: the data isn't normal
H1: the data is normal.

Started with exploring the data to get a quick view of the data, the gender and annual_mileage has the same sample size and from looking at the distribution it looks normal. There for we reject the null hypothesis.
###### 3
Look at the correlation between the annual_mileage and the gender, there was a (Pearson) p value of 0.184 suggesting there is a correlation at the 5% level.
###### 4
With the signed rank P value of 0.04, this would suggest there is a significant difference. Therefor we reject the null hypothesis.


 


Car and House evidence
Many of us pose questions about the data

Are there significant difference between groups
Fuel consumptions between males and females

Go back to data, and continue to pose hypothesis
and do some statistical significance on the data
