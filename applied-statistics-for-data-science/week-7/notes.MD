# Principal Component Analysis

## Example 1
### Leadership
A survey was conducted to assess the function of leaders in different sectors of the economy
namely: manufacturing, agriculture and banking. Eight questions were asked relating to
different aspects of being a team leader. You are required to compare the factor scores of
the new components for each of the different sectors.

#### How To    
    Go to Utilities
    Multivariate Analysis - Principal Component Analysis (Factor Analysis)
    Select Data - Analysis Variables (all)
    Options - PCA - No of Factor (all) - this will be changed over time
    Rotation (none) - will change later
    Details - Analyze - Correlation
    Plots - Path Diagram - Unrotated loadings plots

#### Interpret 
    Correlation Matrix shows a lot of information about variance for each variable

    We want to use all the variables where the Eigenvalue is close to or > 1

    From looking at the first plot, we can see where the data stops being useful when it gets closer to the bottom.

    Change the number of Factor to 2 and see how the data looks
    From the Initil Factor Pattern, we can rotate the x & y to see how the factors are plotted. They could be closer to the alternative axis.

    For rotation, the most common is Varimax and change the plots to rotationed loadings plots.

    After running again, you'll be greeted with the original values again, but below these you can find the rotated values.

    Ability to define has a very negative relationship to factor1 but a very strong relationship to factor2
