Factor Analysis - Principle Part
Use all variables
Factor - PCA 
How many factor to choose (ALL)

Iterated PFA
Next we will pick the number of factors (4)
Rotation - Varimax
Need to see rotation method VARIMAX results (near the bottom)

Export as FactorScore data which will add additional factors as variables
The new factors are independent which were the hidden variables within the original dataset

Exploratory Factor Analysis


Clustering Within SAS

Clustering is better with non correlated data.
