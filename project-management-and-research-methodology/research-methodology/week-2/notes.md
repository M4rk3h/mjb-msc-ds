## Exercise 1
Search online a subject area - for this I used the search engine DuckDuckGo (GGD) and search for the term 'using gis to track covid'. Here are the top 5 results which I looked at:

1 - Spatial analysis and GIS in the study of COVID-19. A review - https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969720335531 - Accessed 15/03/2021

2 - Mapping the curve: how GIS is helping the Covid-19 response - https://geographical.co.uk/people/development/item/3676-how-gis-is-helping-the-covid-19-response - Accessed 15/03/2021
 
2 - Geographical tracking and mapping of coronavirus disease COVID-19/severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) epidemic and associated events around the world: how 21st century GIS technologies are supporting the global fight against outbreaks and epidemics - https://ij-healthgeographics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12942-020-00202-8 - Accessed 15/03/2021
 
4 - GIS Systems Lead Response to COVID-19 - https://www.esri.com/about/newsroom/arcuser/gis-systems-lead-response-to-covid-19/ - Accessed 15/03/2021
 
5 - How enterprises are using GIS to track Covid-19 impact - https://cio.economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/strategy-and-management/how-enterprises-are-using-gis-to-track-covid-19-impact/74821102 - Accessed 15/03/2021

One of the five results found was a peer reviewed journal article, so simply searching the internet wouldn't be appropriate enough for research.

## Exercise 2
When trying to use FindIt with the same search term as above, it is a bit more difficult to get something as specific which has been peer reviewed. I started with looking for GIS for a general background of the area, whilst also looking for 'GIS AND COVID'.

## Exercise 3
When looking at Sage Research Methods, there were multiple Handbooks, Books and more information around GIS. These could provide a lot more background information around the subject of GIS with how they approached using this software.

- What did they use GIS for?
- what software did they use?
- what backend did they use?
- Did they collect data?

A lot of these questions will be explored further closer to the date.

## Exercise 4
- Q1: Does your study have a research question which is spelled out clearly?
Not with the current search term above, but would require more research into the area.

- Q2: You should be aware of where your research question came from and what you want to achieve with it:
 - Is YOUR interest in the contents of the research question the main motivation?
 - Or is answering the research question more a means to an end, like obtaining an MSc degreee?

- Q3: How many research questions does your study have?
 - Are there too many?
 - Which is the main question?

- Q4: Can your research question be answered?
 - What could an answer look like?

- Q5: Can your research question be answered empirically?
 - Who can provide insights for that?
 - Can you reach these people? (in lockdown?).
 - Where can you find such people?
 - What situations can give you insights for answering your research question, and are these situations accessible?

- Q6: How clearly is your research question formulated?

- Q7: What are the methodological consequences of the research question?
 - What resources are needed (e.g. software, data, time)?

- Q8: If necessary for the type of study you chose, did you formulate hypotheses?
 - Are they formulated clearly, in a well-defined and testable way?

- Q9: Can your hypothesis be tested? By which methods?
