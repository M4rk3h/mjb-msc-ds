Understanding Capacity of the NHS
    - This could have a lot of background which could steal from the word count.

Graphs and Tables could be very useful for the word count, visualisations could be key to showing the data.



What sort of knowledge of database processing will be needed for this?
May need Manipulating of the data to be explored in multiple ways.

AVG could be very high, but the Mode could be 0.

Could be asked about my background with NHS and Health - which is none but willing to learn.
I have done a lot of R programming and Python in the past and can apply these skills to health care data hopefully.
