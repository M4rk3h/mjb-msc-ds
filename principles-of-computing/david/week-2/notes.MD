Can you write a Python Program to read all the recorded Crime that occurred in the South Wales Police force area last month (September 2020) and produce some summary statistics for each different crime type (for example, in much the same way as we've used MS EXCEL (e.g COUNTIF) and MS ACCESS (e.g. SELECT DISTINCT / GROUP BY) in the Coursework Tutorial Exercise.  Your program should produce:

A List of all the different crime types (e.g. Burglary etc.) that were recorded in September 2020;

The total number of crimes that occurred in South Wales in September 2020;

The total number of crimes of each different crime type that occurred in September 2020;

A breakdown of all different crime types as a percentage of all crime in September 2020.

ADVANCED EXERCISE: How did the level of crime in September 2020 compare with August 2020 or September 2019?

ADVANCED EXERCISE: Can you visualise your results (from 3, 4, or 5), e.g. as a bar or pie chart?
